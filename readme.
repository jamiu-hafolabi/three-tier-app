Three-tier architecture is a software architecture pattern that separates an application into three layers.

🔸Presentation layer ➡️ handles user interaction

🔸Application layer(backend logic) ➡️ processes business logic and data processing

🔸Data layer (database) ➡️ manages data storage and retrieval
